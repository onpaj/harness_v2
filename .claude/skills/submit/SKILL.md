# Submit — Send Spec to AgentHarness Pipeline

Takes the last spec written by `superpowers:brainstorming` and submits it to the AgentHarness autonomous development pipeline.

## Steps

### 1. Locate the spec

Check in this order:

1. **Current context** — was a spec file path mentioned or just written this session?
2. **Project spec directories** — find the most recently modified spec on disk:

```bash
ls -t docs/features/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1
ls -t docs/superpowers/specs/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1
```

Use whichever returns a result. If both are empty, tell the user no spec was found and stop.

### 2. Submit

```bash
agentharness submit <spec-path>
```

This uploads the spec and returns a **feature ID** (e.g. `feat-20260425-abc123`).

### 4. Tell the user

- The feature ID
- They can review or edit the spec at `artifacts/<feature-id>/brief.md` before starting
- When ready: run `/oneshot <issue-number>` to start the pipeline
