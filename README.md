# harness

Orchestration harness for multiple agents. The unit of work is a **task**; it moves
between queues according to a **workflow**, which is a small state machine with
explicit edges for each outcome.

Phase 1 is a POC of the whole loop: a task flows through the workflow from `start`
to `end`, but the work is stood in for by a dummy behavior for now. Real agents,
persistent storage, and git arrive in later phases.

## Installation

The harness installs as a [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) tool — no clone, no
virtualenv to manage:

```sh
uv tool install git+https://github.com/onpaj/harness_v2.git
```

That puts a `harness` command on your `PATH` (uv's shim in `~/.local/bin`).
Verify it:

```sh
harness --version
```

If you don't have uv yet:

```sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ (uv will fetch one if you have none)
- `git` >= 2.38, for worktree support
- the [`claude` CLI](https://claude.ai/code), installed and **authenticated** —
  every agent step shells out to it, so an expired login fails every task
- a GitHub token with `repo` scope, if you want issues ingested; `gh auth login`
  is enough (see [Running it as a service](#running-it-as-a-service))

### First run

```sh
harness init --root ~/harness-root
```

That writes the workflow, the default agent personas, and an empty `repos.json`.
Map each repo name to its path on this machine before running anything real:

```jsonc
// ~/harness-root/repos.json
{
  "my-app": "/Users/you/code/my-app"
}
```

The name is what `harness submit --repo <name>` takes; the harness derives the
per-task worktree path itself. Note that a task branches from whatever the
registered clone currently has checked out, so point it at a clone that stays
on your default branch.

### Updating

```sh
harness update
```

Runs `uv tool upgrade harness` and reports the version it installed. A running
service keeps the old code until you restart it — `harness update` prints the
exact command.

Versions are cut automatically: every push to `main` runs the test suite, and
[python-semantic-release](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/)
derives the next version from the [conventional
commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) since the last tag (`feat:` →
minor, `fix:`/`perf:` → patch, `BREAKING CHANGE:` → major), tags it and cuts a
GitHub release. `harness --version` reports both the version and the exact
commit it was built from.

To pin instead of tracking `main`:

```sh
uv tool install git+https://github.com/onpaj/harness_v2.git@v0.2.0
```

### Contributing

Commit messages must follow conventional commits — the release workflow reads
them to decide the next version. `feat:` and `fix:` are what move it; `docs:`,
`chore:`, `test:`, `refactor:` and `ci:` appear in the notes without cutting a
release on their own.

## Running it as a service

`harness run` in a terminal dies with the terminal. To keep the loop supervised
and bring it back at login (macOS launchd):

```sh
harness service install --root ~/harness-root
```

That generates a wrapper and a LaunchAgent, then starts it. Afterwards:

```sh
harness service status      # loaded? pid? last exit code?
harness service uninstall   # stop it and remove the agent
```

The service needs a GitHub token to ingest issues. It does **not** store one:
the generated wrapper takes `GITHUB_TOKEN` if it is already set, and otherwise
asks `gh auth token` for the one in your keyring — so `gh auth login` is the
only setup. Without a token the harness still runs; it just stops pulling
issues, and `harness submit` keeps working.

The LaunchAgent points at uv's shim rather than at a virtualenv, so
`harness update` does not invalidate it; restart the service to pick the new
version up.

Logs land in `<root>/logs/harness.log` and `<root>/logs/harness.error.log`.

### Autoupdating the service

`harness update` above is manual. To have it run on a schedule — and, when a
real update landed, restart the run-loop service so the new code is actually
live — install a second, independent LaunchAgent:

```sh
harness service autoupdate install --root ~/harness-root --every 15m
```

`--every` accepts whole minutes, hours or days (`15m`, `2h`, `1d`) — there is
no hourly floor, `1m` is a valid schedule. Each firing runs `harness update`
and, only when the reported version actually changed, kickstarts the main
service (`com.harness` by default; pass `--service-label` if you installed the
run-loop service under a different `--label`). A no-op upgrade never restarts
anything. Installing also runs the update once immediately (the LaunchAgent's
`RunAtLoad`), so don't be surprised by an entry in the log the moment
`install` returns.

```sh
harness service autoupdate status      # loaded? configured interval?
harness service autoupdate uninstall   # stop it and remove the agent
```

`autoupdate uninstall` only touches the autoupdate LaunchAgent — the run-loop
service it restarts is untouched. Logs land in
`<root>/logs/harness-autoupdate.log` and `<root>/logs/harness-autoupdate.error.log`,
separate from the run-loop's own log files. This needs no `GITHUB_TOKEN` — it
only shells out to `uv` and, on a real change, `launchctl kickstart`.

## Developing

Working on the harness itself needs a clone and an editable install:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/onpaj/harness_v2.git
cd harness_v2
python3.11 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"
.venv/bin/pytest -q
```

## Quick start

```sh
harness init --root /tmp/harness-demo
harness submit --root /tmp/harness-demo --repo app-backend \
    --data '{"request": "add rate limiting"}'
harness run --root /tmp/harness-demo --delay 0.5 --request-changes-at review
```

### Running without an agent

Every step shells out to `claude`, so an unavailable or unauthenticated CLI
fails every task. To exercise the pipeline itself — worktree, commits, push,
pull request — without it:

```sh
harness run --root ~/harness-root --agent dummy
```

The step behaviors become stubs that write an artifact and commit; everything
around them stays real, including the PR that `land` opens. Pair it with
`--forge fake` if you want no GitHub calls at all.

## Board

Alongside the orchestration loop, `harness run` serves a read-only board at
`http://127.0.0.1:8420/`. The columns are the workflow steps plus `done` and
`failed`, the cards are tasks, and a click shows metadata and history. The board
updates itself over SSE.

`--api-port 0` turns the board off.

The board reads exclusively through the `BoardView` port. That the tasks are JSON
files and the queues directories, it does not know — and must not.

## How work flows

```
tasks/ ──dispatcher──> queues/<step>/ ──consumer──> tasks/ ──dispatcher──> …
                                                                    │
                                                              done/ or failed/
```

1. The dispatcher takes a task from `tasks/`, loads the workflow by
   `workflowTemplate`, and finds the target step from the `(status, lastOutcome)`
   pair.
2. It overwrites `status`, appends a line to `history`, and moves the task into
   `queues/<step>/`.
3. The consumer over that queue hands the task to `ConsumerBehavior`, gets back an
   outcome (`done` or `request_changes`), writes it, and returns the task to
   `tasks/`.
4. Once an edge points at `end`, the task ends up in `done/`. Anything unroutable
   ends up in `failed/` with the reason in its history.

## Workflow

```json
{
  "name": "default",
  "start": "plan",
  "transitions": [
    {"from": "plan", "on": "done", "to": "design"},
    {"from": "review", "on": "done", "to": "end"},
    {"from": "review", "on": "request_changes", "to": "development"}
  ]
}
```

Backward edges are explicit and need not be symmetric. Retrying the same step is
expressed as `to == from`.

## Architecture

Every moving part sits behind a port and is swapped by swapping the driver:

| Port | Phase 1 | Later |
|---|---|---|
| `TaskQueue` | directory of JSON files | storage queue |
| `EnqueueStrategy` | FIFO by `created` | priority, fair-share |
| `WorkflowRepository` | `workflows/<name>.json` | DB, API |
| `ConsumerBehavior` | sleep → `done` | real agent |
| `EventSink` | lines on stdout | OTel |

Decision-making is split into three non-overlapping roles: `ConsumerBehavior` says
*what happened*, the dispatcher *where it goes next*, and the consumer just
delivers.
